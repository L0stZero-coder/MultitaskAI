# MultitaskAI
MultitaskAI_Unity is an experimental Unity project that simulates an intelligent AI system capable of multitasking in a game environment. Inspired by VTuber AI models like Neuro-sama, this project combines real-time Twitch chat interaction, voice command recognition, and game control logic into a single system.
